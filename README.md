# ğŸ§  RPA Challenge Automation in Google Colab

This repository provides a Google Colab-compatible script that:

1. Installs **Google Chrome** and its dependencies.
2. Automatically detects and installs the correct **ChromeDriver**.
3. Uses **Selenium** to complete the [RPA Challenge](https://rpachallenge.com/) form with data from a downloaded Excel file.

> ğŸ’» No local setup required â€” just **Open in Colab**, run the cells, and watch the magic happen in the cloud.
